âœ… Overall Accuracy
Accuracy: 95%
This means the model correctly predicted the class for 83 out of 87 test images.

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total = (64 + 19) / 87 = 0.95

ðŸ“Š Per-Class Performance
1. Melanoma
Support: 65 samples

Precision: 0.96 â†’ Out of all images the model predicted as melanoma, 96% were actually melanoma.

Recall: 0.98 â†’ Out of 65 actual melanoma images, 98% were correctly identified.

F1-score: 0.97 â†’ Harmonic mean of precision and recall, showing excellent performance.

2. Vascular Lesion
Support: 22 samples

Precision: 0.95 â†’ Out of all vascular lesion predictions, 95% were correct.

Recall: 0.86 â†’ Out of 22 actual vascular lesion images, only 86% were detected (3 were misclassified).

F1-score: 0.90 â†’ Still strong, but lower than melanoma due to slightly weaker recall.

ðŸŸ¡ Slight drop in recall for vascular lesion could be due to the smaller number of samples (140 total), which makes it harder for the model to generalize.

                Predicted
              | melanoma | vascular
Actual --------|----------|---------
melanoma       |   64     |   1
vascular       |   3      |   19
Out of 65 melanoma: 64 correct, 1 misclassified

Out of 22 vascular lesions: 19 correct, 3 misclassified

ðŸŸ¢ Indicates very few false positives and false negatives, which is great for medical applications.

ðŸ“ˆ ROC AUC Score: 0.984
AUC near 1.0 is excellent.

Shows the model is very good at distinguishing between the two classes regardless of the decision threshold.
